# Hardware Design
> Projects and homework of hardware design lab and logic design class

## Overview
In hardware design lab, I implemented simple hardware components (adders, timers, VGA controllers...)
with Verilog code on FPGA boards.  
Logic design class is a prerequisite introducing hardware basics and Verilog.  
I really enjoyed the feeling of designing hardware and 
I imagined myself connecting wires when I wrote Verilog code.

## Reflections
What designing hardware taught me is _Designing precedes coding_. 
I was often desparated if I started coding immediately after reading the specs.
Besides, I found that **design the big picture first, then start off implementing small components** 
is the most efficient way of developing.
